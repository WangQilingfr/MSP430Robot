- difference :
	1. capital
	2. order
- ideas
	1. important to respect certain rules & good practices
	2. need to keep good testability, maintainability and clarity
	3. need to define interfaces and the architecture clarily
	4. use some tools for checking the code report such as LDRA
	5. code review, training and communication between developers
	6. add the check function inside the IDE, ex. CCS can do the job 
	as LDRA and advice the user for good practices
	
M3 :
interruption	
race condition with the motor's PWM, encoder (increase the turns and steps by ISR) and I2C communication with the by the compass
the interruption is an important hazard,

- lack of validation test
- no code review
- overconfidence
- cargo cult programming : reuse code without understanding it
- not synchronized operator interface : race condition
- flag variable incrementation causes arithemtic overflow
- choice of language - not the primary cause 

difference between reuse code and COTS. 
- reuse code is copy from internet without understanding the code
- COTS is bought from supplier, and need to clearify the responsibility in contract.
